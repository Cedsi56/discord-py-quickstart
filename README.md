# discord-py-quickstart
 Create a bot for discord using python!

 To run this project, imports required libraries from requirements.txt

 You will need a ".env" file that contains your discord bot token in this format:
 
 `DISCORD_TOKEN=YourTokenHere`
 
 Once you have imported the libraries and set up the .env, run the bot using a CMD :
 
 `python bot.py`
